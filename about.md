#### What is Chronicles?

**Chronicle** is a wasm module. It is a tiny "CMS" that serve markdown files. To "serve" **Chronicle** through HTTP, you need **[Capsule](https://github.com/bots-garden/capsule)**, a little [#wasm](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23wasm&src=typed_query&f=top) application server.

#### 🤔 Why Chronicles?

My first plan is to practice self-hosting on a Raspberry Pi 3+, stay tuned 😀

#### What is Capsule?

**Capsule** is a WebAssembly function launcher(runner). With **Capsule**, you can execute a function of a wasm module, 
or serve a function of a wasm module through HTTP, NATS or MQTT.

> 🖐 **The functions are developed with [GoLang](https://go.dev/) and compiled to wasm with [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/)**
